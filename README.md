Hi! I'm @SjoerdDevelops,\
a Robotics Engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering and Education who found his true passion in Robotics, Human-Machine Interaction and Programming.

## Currently learning
### Software Architecture
I like to invest most of my spare reading about and studying design patterns to write better code. 

### Productivity
For the past year I have been investing a lot of time in becoming more productive, this involves:
- Establishing improved workflows by using git, docker containers, VS Code Extensions and Profiles.
- Improving my typing (Yes, really!). Since I do most of my work behind a keyboard I figured it a worthwhile investment to improve my typing speed by frequently practicing using online tool like `keybr.com` and `monkeytype.com`.

## Skills and Tools
### Code
`C#/.NET` `C/C++` `Python`\
*Past experience with:* `HTML` `CSS` `Javascript` `PHP` `MySQL`

### Tools
`VS Code` `Docker` `Git` `Unity` `Obsidian` `CMake`
